# Frontend-Backend Integration

## ✅ Integration Complete

The frontend has been successfully connected to the backend API. Here's what was implemented:

### 🔧 What Was Added

1. **API Service** (`src/lib/api.ts`)
   - TypeScript interfaces for API requests/responses
   - Error handling with custom ApiError class
   - Health check and video generation endpoints
   - Configurable backend URL support

2. **Frontend Integration** (`src/app/page.tsx`)
   - Backend connection status indicator
   - Form handling with API calls
   - Loading states and progress indicators
   - Error message display
   - Video player component (ready for when videos are generated)

3. **Configuration** (`.env.local`)
   - Environment variable for backend URL
   - Currently configured to use deployed Railway backend
   - Easy to switch between local and deployed backends

4. **Testing** (`test-api-integration.js`)
   - Automated test script to verify API connectivity
   - Tests both local and deployed backend URLs
   - Validates health check and video generation endpoints

### 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:3000

2. **Test API integration:**
   ```bash
   node test-api-integration.js
   ```

3. **Use the application:**
   - Enter a LeetCode problem title (e.g., "Two Sum")
   - Select a programming language
   - Click one of the video type buttons
   - See the backend response (currently returns "generating" status)

### 🔗 Backend Connection

- **Status**: ✅ Connected to deployed backend
- **URL**: https://leetcode-video-generator.railway.app
- **Health Check**: Working
- **Video Generation**: Endpoint exists (returns placeholder response)

### 🎯 Current Behavior

- Frontend successfully calls the backend API
- Backend connection status is displayed to users
- Form validation and error handling work correctly
- Loading states provide user feedback
- Video generation returns "generating" status (placeholder implementation)

### 🔄 Next Steps

The integration is complete and ready for the next tasks:
- Task 4: Add database to deployed backend
- Task 5: Build solution generation system
- Task 6: Implement Manim script generation
- Task 7: Add video rendering pipeline

### 🛠️ Configuration Options

To use a different backend:

1. **Local backend:**
   ```bash
   # In .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   
   # Start local backend
   cd backend && python main.py
   ```

2. **Different deployed backend:**
   ```bash
   # In .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
   ```

The frontend will automatically detect and display the backend connection status.
